                Four years ago a young french man set sails for Iceland to discover the country of fire and ice. In search for adventure and wanting to fit in with the vikings he ended up falling in love with a local. Without a beard and blond hair the case seemed to be lost but that was without counting on his french touch to seduce her. After few nights getting to know each other she fell for his charm and as couch surfing goes he finally upgraded from the sofa!
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-css">
                 Then fast forward, the next year was marked by numerous back and forth between France and Iceland, trying to build up as a couple despite a long distance relationship. Figuring out that they both shared a passion for travelling (and mainly dying to finally be together) they decided to take off on a year long world trip across Asia and Africa. 24/7 on each others back, what a change! If we would survive this trip we would not have any secrets anymore! Let's face it, it was not always easy but we made it and moreover, feel like we only grew stronger together!
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-css">
                After the trip it was finally time to settle down. We both made the decision to settle in beautiful Iceland to build our nest. Isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean it was the perfect place to get our lives together and continue nurturing our relationship. Two years later he proposed and a new chapter opens. We are excited to share with all of you the first page as a husband and wife.

                On a side note. The church is warmed so no worries! We recommend bringing warm boots, a coat, gloves and a hat for the two minutes walk over to Iðnó. Bringing heels in a bag is normal in Iceland, so no need to wear boots all night, unless you want to!
