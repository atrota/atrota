                Four years ago a young french man set sails for Iceland to discover the country of ice and fire. In search of adventure and wanting to fit in with the vikings he ended up falling in love with a local. Without beard and blond hair the case seemed to be lost but that was without counting on his french touch to seduce her, after few nights getting to know each other she fell under his charm and as couch surfing goes he finally upgraded from the sofa!
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-css">
                 Then fast forward, the next year is marked by numerous back and forth between France and Iceland, trying to build us as a couple despite a long distance relationship. Figuring out that we both share a passion for travelling (and mainly dying to finally live together) we decide to take off on a year long world trip across Asia and Africa. 24/7 on each others back, what a change! If we survive this we will not have any secrets anymore, and let's face it, it was not always easy but we made it and felt that we only grew stronger from this experience! 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-css">
                After that, it was time to finally settle down and we both made the decision to settle in beautiful Iceland to build our nest. Isolated in the Atlantic Ocean it was the perfect place to get our lives together and continue nurturing our relationship. Two years later, he finally proposed, a new chapter opens and we are both looking forward to share the first page with you all in December.

                We are both looking forward to celebrate our union and share this really special moment with our family and friends. The ceremony will take place at Dómkirkjan by Austurvöllur at 4:30 PM followed by the reception and a dinner at Iðnó at 5.15PM. Please bring your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5mWQFGF7w8">babelfish</a> with you as there will be talks in Icelandic, French and English!

                On a side note The church is warmed so no worries! We recommend bringing warm boots,  coats, gloves and a hat for the two minutes walk over to Iðnó. Bringing heels in a bag is normal in Iceland, so no need to wear boots all night, unless you want to!

                We have not signed up with any gift registry but we are saving for our honeymoon and an urn will be available at Iðnó.
